# awesome-PhD [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of carefully selected tools and resources you can use in your career. These are all things I wish I knew when starting my PhD, since they make your life SO MUCH easier. These tools are both for early career as well as more senior researchers (or even if you are not in academia, for that matter).

The original Twitter thread where I started this list can be found [here](https://twitter.com/helenahhartmann/status/1473735195920633859).

This repository is aimed to be a living, constantly developing resource where everybody can contribute with new resources! If you want to contribute, please read the contribution guidelines first, then send a pull request or contact me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/helenahhartmann).

## Want to contribute?

Before you submit a contribution via a pull request, please read the following guidelines first.

1) Is the tool you are suggesting in fact really awesome, tried and tested and therefore worthy to be included in this list?
2) Please submit a separate pull request for each suggestion, that makes my life so much easier!
3) Think about what category your suggestion belongs into or suggest a new one, if it doesn't exist.
4) Name your suggestion with a useful title 
5) Each entry should roughly follow the same format: ```[TITLE OF RESOURCE](Link to resource): Short description of what the resource is and does.```
6) Check your spelling before submitting the pull request!

## List of resources (sorted alphabetically in categories)

### Crediting

- [CITATION DIVERSITY STATEMENT](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32762966/): To increase awareness about citation bias and mitigate it, by checking for and transparently reporting proportions of citing male and female first and last authors, use the citation diversity statement by Zurn et al. (2020, TICS).
- [CREDIT AUTHOR STATEMENT](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/policies-and-guidelines/credit-author-statement): Use the CRedit Author Statement by Brandt et al. (2015, Learned Publishing) to report each author’s proper contribution to a manuscript.
- [TENZING](https://rollercoaster.shinyapps.io/tenzing/): Use the Tenzing ShinyApp for quickly and easily documenting contributorship.

### Literature Search

- [CONNECTED PAPERS](https://www.connectedpapers.com/): To explore connections between published papers (e.g., for a literature review), use Connected Papers. This is also nice to see the reach of your own research! It is a "unique, visual tool to help researchers and applied scientists find and explore papers relevant to their field of work".
- [LITERATURE EXCEL SHEET](https://twitter.com/SteMcQuilliam/status/1252241904810557448?s=20): No literature review will ever be the same again, if you use this tutorial to organize all your literature in Excel.
- [RESEARCHRABBIT](https://www.researchrabbit.ai/): Use ResearchRabbit to find both germinal and future works from a single (or multiple) works.
- [LITMAPS](https://www.litmaps.co/): Ana all-rounder tool for visual research navigation, citation network search, and team synchronization.

### Miscellaneous

- [SEMANTIC SCALE NETWORK](rosenbusch.shinyapps.io/semantic_net/): If you want to create a new scale but are not sure whether it exists already, check the Semantic Scale Network to detect semantically related (psychological) scales. You can also add your own scales in there to extend the database.

### Organization

- [NOTION](http://notion.so/): I've said it before and I'll say it again - Notion is the best application there is to keep all your PhD mess in one place.

### Presentation

- [CANVA](www.canva.com): Canva is amazing for creating content such as slides, figures and there are so many great (and free!) designs to choose from.
- [MIRO](https://miro.com/): You can use Miro for creating visual presentations of anything, and most of all, for collaboration with others! The possibilities are endless.

### Publication

- [JOURNAL-AUTHOR-NAME-ESTIMATOR](jane.biosemantics.org): If you don’t know who to suggest as a reviewer or what journal to submit your paper to, check out JANE.
- [JOURNAL RATER](https://phdvoice.org/journalrater/): If you want to know about the review process and manuscript handling, check out the Journal Rater by [@PhDVoice](https://twitter.com/PhDVoice). Because “life’s too short to put up with reviewer 2’s”.
- [SHERPA ROMEO](v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/): If you are not sure whether you are allowed to upload a preprint prior to journal submission.
- [UNPAYWALL](unpaywall.org): As an alternative to SciHub, consider Unpaywall.
- [10 WAYS TO FIND OPEN ACCESS ARTICLES](https://alelazic.blogspot.com/2021/11/ten-ways-to-find-open-access-articles.html), curated by [AleLazic](https://twitter.com/AleLazic).

### Statistics

- [STATCHECK](www.statcheck.io): To check a PDF, DOCX or HTML file for errors in statistical reporting, upload it to Statcheck. Some journals even officially request this now (e.g., Psychological Science).

### Website

- [WOWCHEMY WEBSITE](https://twitter.com/dsquintana/status/1310715433654382599?s=20): If you want to create your own website, but have no clue where to start, check out [Daniel Quintana](https://twitter.com/dsquintana)'s extremely easy tutorial! Also have a look at [my website](www.helenahartmann.com) for an example.

### Writing

- [RECITEWORKS](): To check your in-text citations and reference lists for errors, use [Reciteworks](www.reciteworks.com).
- [APA-STYLE WORD DOCUMENT](https://twitter.com/NicolasFNL/status/1357048003027230726?s=20): Thanks to [@NicolasFNL](https://twitter.com/NicolasFNL) for telling me about the readymade APA-style word document option, where you can directly initialize the right formatting in Word.
