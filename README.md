# MyAwesomePhD

These are all the resources I wish I knew when starting my PhD. Since then, I have discovered a multitude of helpful research-related tools, for early career as well as more sensior academics (or non-academics, for that matter). The original tweet can be found [here](https://twitter.com/helenahhartmann/status/1473735195920633859).

This repository is aimed to be a living, constantly developing resource where everybody can contribute with new resources!

## List of resources (sorted alphabetically in categories)

### Crediting

- CITATION DIVERSITY STATEMENT: To increase awareness about citation bias and mitigate it, by checking for and transparently reporting proportions of citing male and female first and last authors, use the citation diversity statement by [Zurn et al. (2020, TICS)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32762966/).
- CREDIT AUTHOR STATEMENT: Use the [CRedit Author Statement](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/policies-and-guidelines/credit-author-statement) by Brandt et al. (2015, Learned Publishing) to report each author’s proper contribution to a manuscript.
- TENZING: Use the [Tenzing ShinyApp](https://rollercoaster.shinyapps.io/tenzing/) for quickly and easily documenting contributorship!

### Literature Search

- CONNECTED PAPERS: To explore connections between published papers (e.g., for a literature review), use [Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/). This is also nice to see the reach of your own research! It is a "unique, visual tool to help researchers and applied scientists find and explore papers relevant to their field of work".
- LITERATURE REVIEW: No literature review will ever be the same again, if you use this [tutorial](https://twitter.com/SteMcQuilliam/status/1252241904810557448?s=20) to organize your literature in Excel.
- RESEARCHRABBIT: Use [ResearchRabbit](https://www.researchrabbit.ai/) to find both germinal and future works from a single (or multiple) works!
- LITMAPS: Ann all-rounder tool for visual research navigation, citation network search, and team synchronization is [Litmaps](https://www.litmaps.co/).

### Miscellaneous

- SEMANTIC SCALE NETWORK: If you want to create a new scale but are not sure whether it exists already, check the [Semantic Scale Network](rosenbusch.shinyapps.io/semantic_net/) to detect semantically related (psychological) scales. You can also add your own scales in there to extend the database.

### Organization

- NOTION: I've said it before and I'll say it again: [Notion](http://notion.so/) is the best application there is to keep all your PhD mess in one place.

### Presentation

- CANVA: [Canva](www.canva.com) is amazing for creating content such as slides, figures and there are so many great (and free!) designs to choose from!
- MIRO: You can use [Miro](https://miro.com/) for creating visual presentations of anything, and most of all, for collaboration with others! The possibilities are endless.

### Publication

- JOURNAL-AUTHOR-NAME-ESTIMATOR: If you don’t know who to suggest as a reviewer or what journal to submit your paper to, check out JANE – the [Journal-Author-Name-Estimator](jane.biosemantics.org).
- JOURNAL RATER: If you want to know about the review process and manuscript handling, check out the [Journal Rater](https://phdvoice.org/journalrater/) by [@PhDVoice](https://twitter.com/PhDVoice). Because “life’s too short to put up with reviewer 2’s”.
- SHERPA ROMEO: If you are not sure whether you are allowed to upload a preprint prior to journal submission, check [Sherpa Romeo](v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/).
- UNPAYWALL: As an alternative to SciHub, consider [Unpaywall](unpaywall.org).
- Aleksandra Lazic wrote about [10 ways to find open access articles](https://alelazic.blogspot.com/2021/11/ten-ways-to-find-open-access-articles.html).

### Statistics

- STATCHECK: To check a PDF, DOCX or HTML file for errors in statistical reporting, upload it to [Statcheck](www.statcheck.io). Some journals even officially request this now (e.g., Psychological Science).

### Website

- WEBSITE: If you want to create your own website, but have no clue where to start, check out Daniel Quintana's extremely [easy tutorial](https://twitter.com/dsquintana/status/1310715433654382599?s=20)! Check [my website](www.helenahartmann.com) for an example!

### Writing

- RECITEWORKS: To check your in-text citations and reference lists for errors, use [Reciteworks](www.reciteworks.com).
- APA-STYLE IN WORD: Thanks to @NicolasFNL for telling me about the readymade [APA-style word document](https://twitter.com/NicolasFNL/status/1357048003027230726?s=20) option!
