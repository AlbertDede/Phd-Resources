# MyAwesomePhD

These are all the resources I wish I knew when starting my PhD. Since then, I have discovered a multitude of helpful research-related tools, for early career as well as more sensior academics (or non-academics, for that matter). 

This repository is aimed to be a living, constantly developing resource where everybody can contribute with new resources!

1) If you don’t know who to suggest as a reviewer or what journal to submit your paper to, check out JANE – the [Journal-Author-Name-Estimator](jane.biosemantics.org).

2) If you want to know about the review process and manuscript handling, check out the [Journal Rater](https://phdvoice.org/journalrater/) by [@PhDVoice](https://twitter.com/PhDVoice). Because “life’s too short to put up with reviewer 2’s”.

3) To check a PDF, DOCX or HTML file for errors in statistical reporting, upload it to [Statcheck](www.statcheck.io). Some journals even officially request this now (e.g., Psychological Science).

4) To check your in-text citations and reference lists for errors, use [Reciteworks](www.reciteworks.com).

5) If you are not sure whether you are allowed to upload a preprint prior to journal submission, check [Sherpa Romeo](v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/).

6) To explore connections between published papers (e.g., for a literature review), use [Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/). This is also nice to see the reach of your own research! It is a "unique, visual tool to help researchers and applied scientists find and explore papers relevant to their field of work".

7) To increase awareness about citation bias and mitigate it, by checking for and transparently reporting proportions of citing male and female first and last authors, use the citation diversity statement by [Zurn et al. (2020, TICS)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32762966/).

8) Use the [CRedit Author Statement](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/policies-and-guidelines/credit-author-statement) by Brandt et al. (2015, Learned Publishing) to report each author’s proper contribution to a manuscript.

9) If you want to create a new scale but are not sure whether it exists already, check the [Semantic Scale Network](rosenbusch.shinyapps.io/semantic_net/) to detect semantically related (psychological) scales. You can also add your own scales in there to extend the database.

10) As an alternative to SciHub, consider [Unpaywall](unpaywall.org)

11) If you want to create your own website, but have no clue where to start, check out @dsquintana's extremely easy tutorial! Check my website for an example: helenahartmann.com!

12) No literature review will ever be the same again, if you use this [tutorial](https://twitter.com/SteMcQuilliam/status/1252241904810557448?s=20) to organize your literature in Excel.

13) Thanks to @NicolasFNL for telling me about the readymade [APA-style word document](https://twitter.com/NicolasFNL/status/1357048003027230726?s=20) option!

14) I've said it before and I'll say it again: [Notion](http://notion.so/) is the best application there is to keep all your PhD mess in one place.

15) [Canva](www.canva.com) and [Miro](https://miro.com/) are amazing for creating content such as slides, figures and there are so many great (and free!) designs to choose from!
