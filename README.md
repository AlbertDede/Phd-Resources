# awesome-PhD [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of carefully selected tools and resources I wish I knew when starting my PhD. All of these tools make your life SO MUCH easier and are both for early career as well as more senior researchers (or even if you are not in academia, for that matter). The original Twitter thread where I started this list can be found [here](https://twitter.com/helenahhartmann/status/1473735195920633859).

This repository is aimed to be a living, constantly developing resource where everybody can contribute with new resources! If you want to contribute, please read the contribution guidelines [here](https://github.com/helenahartmann/awesome-PhD/blob/main/contributing_guidelines.md) first, then send a pull request or contact me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/helenahhartmann) in case of any questions.

## List of resources 

Sorted alphabetically into sub-categories.

### Crediting

- [CITATION DIVERSITY STATEMENT](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32762966/): To increase awareness about citation bias and mitigate it, by checking for and transparently reporting proportions of citing male and female first and last authors, use the citation diversity statement by Zurn et al. (2020, TICS).
- [CREDIT AUTHOR STATEMENT](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/policies-and-guidelines/credit-author-statement): Use the CRedit Author Statement by Brandt et al. (2015, Learned Publishing) to report each author’s proper contribution to a manuscript.
- [TENZING](https://rollercoaster.shinyapps.io/tenzing/): Use the Tenzing ShinyApp for quickly and easily documenting contributorship.

### Literature

- [CONNECTED PAPERS](https://www.connectedpapers.com/): To explore connections between published papers (e.g., for a literature review), use Connected Papers. This is also nice to see the reach of your own research! It is a "unique, visual tool to help researchers and applied scientists find and explore papers relevant to their field of work".
- [LITERATURE EXCEL SHEET](https://twitter.com/SteMcQuilliam/status/1252241904810557448?s=20): No literature review will ever be the same again, if you use this tutorial to organize all your literature in Excel.
- [LITMAPS](https://www.litmaps.co/): An all-rounder tool for visual research navigation, citation network search, and team synchronization.
- [RESEARCH RABBIT](https://www.researchrabbit.ai/): Use Research Rabbit to find both germinal and future works from a single (or multiple) works.
- [SCHOLARCY](https://www.scholarcy.com/): Want an AI to summarize literature for you? Wait no more, Scholarcy comes to the rescue.

### Miscellaneous

- [SEMANTIC SCALE NETWORK](rosenbusch.shinyapps.io/semantic_net/): If you want to create a new scale but are not sure whether it exists already, check the Semantic Scale Network to detect semantically related (psychological) scales. You can also add your own scales in there to extend the database.

### Organization

- [NOTION](http://notion.so/): I've said it before and I'll say it again - Notion is the best application there is to keep all your PhD mess in one place.
- [TRELLO](https://trello.com/): Trello helps you stay organized and work together with others by letting you create lists about anything you want.

### Presentation

- [CANVA](www.canva.com): Canva is amazing for creating content such as slides, figures and there are so many great (and free!) designs to choose from.
- [MIRO](https://miro.com/): You can use Miro for creating visual presentations of anything, and most of all, for collaboration with others! The possibilities are endless.

### Publication

- [10 WAYS TO FIND OPEN ACCESS ARTICLES](https://alelazic.blogspot.com/2021/11/ten-ways-to-find-open-access-articles.html), curated by [Aleksandra Lazic](https://twitter.com/AleLazic).

- [JOURNAL RATER](https://phdvoice.org/journalrater/): If you want to know about the review process and manuscript handling, check out the Journal Rater by [PhD Voice](https://twitter.com/PhDVoice). Because “life’s too short to put up with reviewer 2’s”.
- [ORCID](https://orcid.org/): Get an ORCID - an "Open Researcher and Contributor ID" which is a persistent digital identifier that you own and control, and that distinguishes you from every other researcher. Link your projects and output to your ORCID.
- [PUBLONS](https://publons.com/about/home/): Use Publons to keep up with all your peer-reviews and publications - it can also be linked to your [ORCID](https://orcid.org/).
- [SCIREV](https://scirev.org/): If you want to know how long the review process for a specific journal is, or people's experience with publishing there, check SciRev.
- [SHERPA ROMEO](v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/): If you are not sure whether you are allowed to upload a preprint prior to journal submission.
- [UNPAYWALL](unpaywall.org): As an alternative to SciHub, consider Unpaywall.

### References

- [RECITEWORKS](www.reciteworks.com): To check your in-text citations and reference lists for errors, use Reciteworks.
- [REFERENCE MANAGEMENT COMPARISON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_reference_management_software): If you are not sure which reference manager to use, check this handy comparison of all the different ones available and whether they will work on your operating system. 

### Statistics

- [STATCHECK](www.statcheck.io): To check a PDF, DOCX or HTML file for errors in statistical reporting, upload it to Statcheck. Some journals even officially request this now (e.g., Psychological Science).

Also have a look at [my website](www.helenahartmann.com) for an example.

### Writing

- [ACRONYMIFY](https://acronymify.com/): If you need a cool and catchy acronym for your paper, project, etc. check out Acronymify.
- [APA-STYLE WORD DOCUMENT](https://twitter.com/NicolasFNL/status/1357048003027230726?s=20): Thanks to [Nicolás F. Narvaez Linares](https://twitter.com/NicolasFNL) for telling me about the readymade APA-style word document option, where you can directly initialize the right formatting in Word.
